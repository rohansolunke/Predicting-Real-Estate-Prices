# Description
The Objective of this project is to create and deploy a machine learning model to evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from the houses in Pune region. This model will aid us in making better real estate decisions by making house price predictions in that area. Various factors influencing the price of a house includes square footage, number of bathrooms and locations. For this we will carry out data exploration for better understanding of data and will require feature engineering to improve the model accuracy.
